# Routing Framework
## Description
This C++ project offers a framework for research projects regarding (strategic)
routing algorithms. It is the result of our work on our ATMOS paper (doi:
10.4230/OASIcs.ATMOS.2020.10) as well as several bachelor theses at the chair
for Algorithm Engineering at the Hasso Plattner Insitute in Potsdam. For the
remainder of this readme, we assume familiarity with the ATMOS paper.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the outer framework as well as the implementation of our
algorithms solving SAP. You find all implementation sourcecode in the `src`
folder. The subdirectory `core` contains the core router part
(framework), responsible for input/output/general datatypes. The other
subdirectores are for each routing submodule ("strategy"). In this repository,
there only is the `ssotd` strategic, which maps to the SAP problem in the paper.
For example, we also implemented other evolutionary algorithms solving SAP,
which define a different strategy. Strategies can have different variants (e.g.
1D-SAP).

Used libraries are found in `lib`. When building, you can find the results in
`build`. All header files should be in `include`.

Please note that due to historic reasons, the naming of problems/algorithms in
the sourcecode differs to the naming in the paper. `SSOTD` maps to the `SAP`
problem in general. The `fulldisjoint` variant maps to `D-SAP`, the
`newnodisjoint` variant maps to `SAP`, and the `newonedisjoint` variant maps to
`1D-SAP`. If the `new` prefix on the variants is missing, that indicates the
fewer criteria variants (Â´FC`).

In the SAP implementations, you will find several optimization techniques not
yet described in any paper. We plan to publish the proofs of correctness in the
journal version of the paper.

## Input and Output Data Format
Due to historic reasons, we are using MATSim's graph and plan format. We refer
to the MATSim user guide for details (https://www.matsim.org/docs/userguide/).
Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with our graph representing on Berlin. The
idea in the `plans.xml` file is that you can specify multiple persons with the
same OD-pair (and starting time) to set how many people should be routed. SAP is
solved for each OD-pair. The framework outputs a plans.xml that can be executed
in the MATSim simulator.

This means you can validate your (and our) algorithms in simulation settings. We
recommend Simunto Via for visulization. Unfortunately, we did not have the time
in our bachelor project to work on simulation evaluations of our algorithm. This
would be a good continuation of our work.

## Building
### Requirements
Make sure to have the following libraries installed on your system.

- Tinyxml2
- GNU Scientific Library (GSL), including the BLAS
- OpenMP

### Makefile Usage
You can build the project using `make` in the project root. By default, we use some debug and protection flags:

```
-g -fstack-protector-strong -fstack-clash-protection -fcf-protection -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -std=c++2a -D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS
```

Furthermore, you can specify `SANITIZE=thread` or `SANITIZE=address` to either include the thread or address sanitizer in your build (default is address). When specifying `TYPE=DEBUG`, in addition to the flags above, the `-O0` flag is added. Without `TYPE=DEBUG`, we use `-O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` instead.

When specifying TYPE=RELEASE, all of these flags are omitted and `-Ofast` is added instead.

To select the used psychological model, you can use the PSYCHMOD variable. We default to user_equilibrium_2r.

To select which module you are building, you can use the STRATEGY variable. We default to SSOTD fulldisjoint. Possible strategies are:
- sstod. In this case, you can also specify SSOTD_VARIANT, which can either be
  onedisjoint, nodisjoint, newonedisjoint, newnodisjoint or fulldisjoint, which is our default.
- The other strategies we worked on are not (yet) published, so we do not
  include them for now.

You can also add more strategies just by creating more subfolders in src. Please
remember to put your headers in include, as this is added to the include path.
Also make sure, if you need more cpp files than one, to expand the Makefile
accordingly. For this, you have to modify the ADDITIONALS variable. Just take a
look at the example for the ea or ssotd and I'm sure you can figure it out.

## Usage
```
./router <graph> <plans> <output>
```
